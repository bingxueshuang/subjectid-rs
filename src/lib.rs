//! A Subject Identifier is a JSON [RFC8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8259) object whose
//! contents may be used to identify a subject within some context. An Identifier Format is a named
//! definition of a set of information that may be used to identify a subject, and the rules for
//! encoding that information as a Subject Identifier; they define the syntax and semantics of
//! Subject Identifiers. A Subject Identifier MUST conform to a specific Identifier Format,
//! and MUST contain a "format" member whose value is the name of that Identifier Format.
//!
//! Every Identifier Format MUST have a unique name registered in the IANA "Security Event
//! Identifier Formats" registry, or a Collision-Resistant Name as defined in
//! [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7519). Identifier Formats that are expected to
//! be used broadly by a variety of parties SHOULD be registered in the "Security Event Identifier
//! Formats" registry.
//!
//! Identifier Format MAY describe more members than are strictly necessary to identify a subject,
//! and MAY describe conditions under which those members are required, optional, or prohibited.
//! The "format" member is reserved for use as described in this specification; Identifier Formats
//! MUST NOT declare any rules regarding the "format" member. Every member within a Subject
//! Identifier MUST match the rules specified for that member by this specification or by Subject
//! Identifier's Identifier Format. A Subject Identifier MUST NOT contain any members prohibited
//! or not described by its Identifier Format, and MUST contain all members required by its
//! Identifier Format.
